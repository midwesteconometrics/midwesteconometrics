            <h3>Message from the MEG Director</h3>
            <p>Dear MEG Community,</p>
            <p>I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some important updates from our recent Annual MEG Conference held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign on October 3-4, 2025. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to JiHyung Lee (Chair of Local Organizing Committee), Marcelo Cunha Medeiros (Best Student Paper Award Selection Committee), and EunYi Chung (Mentoring Workshop for Junior Female Economists) for their outstanding work in organizing this year's conference.</p>

            <h4>Appreciation Award for Larry Marsh</h4>
            <p>During the conference dinner, we held a special ceremony to honor Larry Marsh, the founder of MEG, for his visionary leadership and enduring contributions to our community. Although Larry was unable to attend, I emailed him a photo of the appreciation plaque along with the statement I read at the ceremony and a wonderful message from Jeff Wooldridge that was shared with the participants.</p>
            <p>Larry's dedication over the past three decades has shaped MEG into the vibrant scholarly community it is today, and we are all deeply grateful for his foundational work and ongoing support.</p>

            <h4>MEG Best Student Paper Award Winners</h4>
            <p>I am delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 MEG Best Student Paper Awards:</p>
            <div class="award-winners">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>David Van Dijcke</strong> for the paper entitled "Regression Discontinuity Design with Distribution-Valued Outcomes"</li>
                    <li><strong>Pedro Simon</strong> for the paper entitled "How do Supply Chain Pressures Affect Monetary Policy Transmission?"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Congratulations to both David and Pedro for their outstanding work! I would like to express our deep gratitude to Ken Weakley, a former professor and director of the Investment Workshop at the IU Kelley School of Business, for his generous support that made these awards possible. I would also like to thank Jeff Wooldridge and Michael McCracken for their continued service as standing committee members of the Best Student Paper Award Selection Committee.</p>

            <h4>MEG Website Transition</h4>
            <p>The MEG webpage, which has been graciously created and maintained by Larry at the University of Notre Dame for the past 35 years (https://www3.nd.edu/~meg/), is now in the process of transferring to Indiana University and will be managed by me going forward. The new website can be found at https://midwesteconometrics.github.io/midwesteconometrics/. I will be adding information about Larry's appreciation award and this year's Best Student Paper Award winners to the new website soon. Please let me know if you find any problems with the new webpage or have suggestions to improve it.</p>

            <p>Thank you all for being part of this wonderful community. I look forward to seeing many of you at future MEG meetings.</p>
